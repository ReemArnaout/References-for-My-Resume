Requirements:
You need one kali and one ubuntu machine 

Instructions:
On the Victim machine where detection will run: 
sudo apt-get install python3-psutil

Sources: Attack code functions based on gkbrk code on github. Not completely sourced and much more simplified in my own way. 
AI usage: Used to explain advanced code to get an idea on how to implement alone. Used for debugging and syntax as well.

To run: sudo python3 slowlorisattack.py and enter the victim IP. Same running method for detection.
