In order for the nueral network to run, you need to upload to collab to the folder on right (drag and drop) the python file and deep learning file.

For the spectrograms, you'll be asked to insert wav audio recordings and you can insert as many as you want.

We tried out many csv files in the NN section. bird_binary gave the highest accuracy.

We provided an output for one audio from each group. 

Change runtime to T4 GPU

You can access the project through uploading the notebook on collab, or the link, or opening this folder on vscode and seeing the py file. It is preferrable you open collab since you'll see the outputs of the NN clearly.
